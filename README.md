# ROS Tutorial Package for Human-Centred Robotics

This repository complements the lecture presented on [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/) for the Human-Centred Robotics course taught at Imperial College London.
It is comprised of a C++ tutorial on how to create a "Hello ROS" node, a publisher/subscriber for [turtlesim](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim) navigation and a `.launch` file to encapsulate multiple package processes. 

The directory layout is as follows:
- `docs` contains the tutorial lecture slides
- `include` is empty in this example but typically contains header files
- `launch` contains our package's launch file
- `src` contains the independent nodes
